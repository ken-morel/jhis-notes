# Steps of the SDLC

- Requirement engeneering
- System analysis
- System design
- System implementation
- testing 
- maintainance

## Requirement Engineering
The process has four steps:

### Feasibility study

Focusses towards the goals of the organizaiton,
the study analyzes weather the product can be
practically implemented and if it will contribute
positively to the organisation's objectives,

  A set of opens questions, where the interviewed forumates his answers.

#### Requirement specification

These are user needs of the system.

The functionalities of the system.

#### non-Functional requirements

The constraints of the system:

I want the software to be:

- Make sure they are not ambiguous
- Make sure they are complete

> [!NOTE] Assignment
> In groups of 4 students, you will go out and meet any
> professional, as them the problem they face in their
> jobs, and propose a software to solve one of their
> problems
It should have few parts:
- presentation of the expert
- requirement Engineering
