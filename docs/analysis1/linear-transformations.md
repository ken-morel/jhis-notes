# Linear transformation


### Concepts related to linear transformations

let the linear transformation: $T:\mathbb{V} \implies \mathbb{W}$


The domain of $T$ is $\mathbb{V}$ and it's codomain is $\mathbb{W}$.

The image of the vertor is the correspoiding element in the codomain, while
the _pre-image_ is the image of an _image_ in the domain.
