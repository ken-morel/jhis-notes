# MS Power point

## Intro-like

Microsoft powerpoint is considered as a publishing tool,
you can use it to create `presentations``, organised through
`slides`. And optionally but very advice, to add`transitions`
between them.

## The first view

The first view, that which you get when you are just from
opening your your powerpoint and creating a new blank
presentation is a blank page containing two text boxes:

- The first and higher text box for the big title.
- The second and lower text box for a subtitle.

## Layout

### Font sizes, fonts and spacing

For text layout, it is instead recommended a font size of
minimum 20px(I personally prefer 23px), and a line spacing
of 1.5.

### Bullet points

When dealing with bullet points, use not more than
3-4 points per slide, and 3 lines per point for better
readability.

> [!TIP]
> You can put transitions on the bullets to let them show
> one at a time and individually capture better your
> audience attention.

### Slides numbers

> [!WARNING]
> **NUMBER YOUR SLIDES**

I advice you strongly to make use of page numbers,
as for dealing with [MS Word](./word.md) they are in
the `View` tab(or maybe something else).

> [!WARNING]
> Don't forget to check the
> `Don't show on title slide` checkbox.

## Transitions

Transitions are a very useful tool on powerpoint, they
have a dedicated menu tab, and help your presentations
look more attractive by adding animations between your slides.

I really advice you to use them.

> [!TIP]
> You can enable automatic slideshow in the
> `transitions` tab(On the end right side) to let the slides switch on
> their own.

## Assignment
