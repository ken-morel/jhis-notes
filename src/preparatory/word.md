# MS Word notes

MS word will be required when submitting work to the school
for submitting reports, and some assignments. To make
sure the work is consistent and presentable, there are some
ensured guidelines which must be maintained.

## Body and text

For styling the body and text the following recommendations are
given:

- Use a consistent body font style of _Times New Roman_ or _Arial_,
  and with a font size of 12.
- For the titles and headings, prefer font sizer of at least
  16px.

### Text alignment

Text

## Footer

The footer of the page includes important items like
the page numbers, which you are encouraged to use.

## Content

You are fully encouraged to make use of designs including:

- Tables
- Images and captions
- Table of contents

### Images

To have a better control over positioning of images, you have
two options:

- Positioning the imaging behind the text, or in front of it.
  Making it's position not dependent of the text again.
- Wrapping the image in a `Text box`, and now dealing with
  the text box instead. **Once you have placed the image in
  the text box, always make sure you move and place the
  Text Box, AND NOT THE IMAGE AGAIN.**
